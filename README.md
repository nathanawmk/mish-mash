Distributed DB --> Read/Write/Update. Blockchain --> Decentralised Control trust no machines. Blockchain --> Mistrust to no trust. Blockchain: Read/Append Only --> Distributed Immutable Single source of truth Blockchain Data Format --> Ordered List of records bundled into blocks which are then linked and secured using cryptography |

DEPENDING ON WHO you ask, blockchains are either the most important technological innovation since the internet or a solution looking for a problem.

Only one life, twill soon be past,

Only what’s done for Christ will last.

Fortune favours the bold.

A chain of blocks

Immutable and limitless

Life is short

But the chain lives on 

Until a fork
