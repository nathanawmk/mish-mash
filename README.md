Mish mash of questions and poetry 

1. What makes blockchain different from distributed databases?
2. How is blockchain revolutionary?

=====

Only one life, twill soon be past,
Only whatâ€™s done for Christ will last.
Fortune favours the bold. 
The most careful thing is to dare. 
Esse quam videri. ("To be, rather than to seem")
