“When you’re a student, you’re judged by how well you answer questions. Somebody else asks the questions, and if you give good answers, you’ll get a good grade. But in life, you’re judged by how good your questions are,” - Robert Langer

Why in love with blockchain? Not with others, say, AI, APIs, Big Data, RPA?

Three things: Timeless, Immutable & Backed by an Idea

Blockchain as an idea is timeless. I love timeless ideas, not hype. Blockchain is birthed out of an idea. The creator of bitcoin, Satoshi, believes that fractional reserve banking is broken, thus engraving "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" on the genesis block. Thus, Blockchain is not just another piece of technology -- it is a technology backed by an idea whose time has come. What is more, ideas are bullet proof. They are timeless. 

Blockchain is immutable. (Okay, technical folks, you will disagree and say there is 51% attack and forks). That said, what is on blockchain, lives on forever (almost at least). Think about this -- I engrave my name "Nathan Aw" in the transaction input data payload and this name is engraved in the block which lives forever in a digital world. Unless humankind cease to exist, we can reasonably assume internet will still be around. As long as internet is around, the blockchain lives on. 

Finally, Blockchain is birthed out of an idea. Refer to above.

A chain of blocks

Immutable and limitless

Life is short

But the chain lives on 

Until a fork

Nathan Aw stands at the intersection of blockchain, crypto-law and economics. Equipped with deep understanding of blockchain and hands-on experience on distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), he helps shape the blockchain landscape with an eye toward a crypto-law future where any untrusting individuals could enter a contract with each other to transact value. He holds no crypto position.
