“When you’re a student, you’re judged by how well you answer questions. Somebody else asks the questions, and if you give good answers, you’ll get a good grade. But in life, you’re judged by how good your questions are,” - Robert Langer 

“I wasn’t that good at finding solutions, but I was really good at asking questions.” - Leslie Lamport

“And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” - JFK 

“It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.”
― Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

Ask the right questions and the rest will fall in its rightful place. 
-- Nathan Aw

“The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.” - F Scott Fitzgerald

[Working on blockchain day in and day out not quite knowing if this is just another hype or something truly, truly transformative.]

Why in love with blockchain? Not with others, say, AI, APIs, Big Data, RPA?

Check out this link for some background with my enduring relationship with blockchain --> https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2017/12/05/developer-showcase-series-nathan-aw-ntt-data

Three things: Timeless, Immutable & Backed by an Idea

Blockchain as an idea is timeless. I love timeless ideas, not hype. Blockchain is birthed out of an idea. The creator of bitcoin, Satoshi, believes that fractional reserve banking is broken, thus engraving "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" on the genesis block. Thus, Blockchain is not just another piece of technology -- it is a technology backed by an idea whose time has come. What is more, ideas are bullet proof. They are timeless. 

Blockchain is immutable. (Okay, technical folks, you will disagree and say there is 51% attack and forks.) That said, what is on blockchain, lives on forever (almost at least). Think about this -- I engrave my name "Nathan Aw" in the transaction input data payload and this name is engraved in the block which lives forever in a digital world. Unless humankind cease to exist, we can reasonably assume internet will still be around. As long as internet is around, the blockchain lives on. 

Finally, Blockchain is birthed out of an idea to bring the internet back to its true decentralised and distributed roots, unlike other technologies which was invented to maximise shareholders returns, blockchain purpose was to do the precise opposite -- which is to wrest control from these centralised organisations.

The stars aligned. The dots connected. Everything clicked. 

Did I choose blockchain? No. Blockchain chose me first. Then I chose Blockchain. The order matters.

Is Blockchain truly transformative or just another fad/hype/pixie dust/magic wand? (Quoting Martin Walker, a blockchain naysayer)

I have learned that the truth always lie somewhere in between. First, Blockchain is a belief system -- those who believe and those who do not. I have explored both sides and have come to the conclusion that the claim that blockchain as the panacea to the world's ill is plain and simple falsehood. I will not go into why folks will peddle this falsehood -- am guessing they have vested personal interests. Having said that, I do believe that blockchain has the potential to transform "parts" of human commerce. In that regard, blockchain is truly transformative when applied to the specified problem. 

Most importantly, and very ironically, in this ICO pump and dump frenzy now we are in, we are unwittingly building the next generation decentralisation platform on which innovation can truly flourish. I cannot say it as eloquently as Technology Review. Reproducing in full below. 

"The dot-com bubble of the 1990s is popularly viewed as a period of crazy excess that ended with hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth being destroyed. What’s less often discussed is how all the cheap capital of the boom years helped fund the infrastructure upon which the most important internet innovations would be built after the bubble burst. It paid for the rollout of fiber-optic cable, R&D in 3G networks, and the buildout of giant server farms. All of this would make possible the technologies that are now the bedrock of the world’s most powerful companies: algorithmic search, social media, mobile computing, cloud services, big-data analytics, AI, and more."

What is my conclusion then? The jury is out on this. I don't believe the future will look like what many might have in mind -- think flying cars, etc. Instead we have Tesla now. But you know what I know? The future belongs to those who create it. With that means that with all the research and resources poured into blockchain right now, we can expect something -- what that is, we do not know for sure. What is certain is that it will certainly yield something -- my guess is the next-generation decentralised internet infrastructure.

Is blockchain a solution looking for a problem?

Laser was also labelled as a solution looking for a problem when it was first invented in 1960. Today my mum had her cataracts removed with lasers. At the checkout lanes at my nearby supermarket I use laser barcode scanners to check out. A solution looking for a problem is also a general purpose technology (gpt). Its far ranging applications will soon be realised.

Haikus on blockchains (or Blockchain on Haikus)


'Timeless Chain'

A chain of blocks

Immutable and limitless

Life is short

But the chain lives on 

Until a fork

--------

'Blocks, Chains and Time'

 Infinite number of transactions bundled together in blocks
 
 Many blocks chained together to form the blockchain

 Blockchain should become the chronological record of all human events and humans who have lived
