“When you’re a student, you’re judged by how well you answer questions. Somebody else asks the questions, and if you give good answers, you’ll get a good grade. But in life, you’re judged by how good your questions are,” - Robert Langer 

“I wasn’t that good at finding solutions, but I was really good at asking questions.” - Leslie Lamport

“And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” JFK 

“It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.”

― Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

Ask the right questions and the rest will fall in its rightful place. - Nathan Aw

Why in love with blockchain? Not with others, say, AI, APIs, Big Data, RPA?

Check out this link for some background with my enduring relationship with blockchain --> https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2017/12/05/developer-showcase-series-nathan-aw-ntt-data

Three things: Timeless, Immutable & Backed by an Idea

Blockchain as an idea is timeless. I love timeless ideas, not hype. Blockchain is birthed out of an idea. The creator of bitcoin, Satoshi, believes that fractional reserve banking is broken, thus engraving "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" on the genesis block. Thus, Blockchain is not just another piece of technology -- it is a technology backed by an idea whose time has come. What is more, ideas are bullet proof. They are timeless. 

Blockchain is immutable. (Okay, technical folks, you will disagree and say there is 51% attack and forks). That said, what is on blockchain, lives on forever (almost at least). Think about this -- I engrave my name "Nathan Aw" in the transaction input data payload and this name is engraved in the block which lives forever in a digital world. Unless humankind cease to exist, we can reasonably assume internet will still be around. As long as internet is around, the blockchain lives on. 

Finally, Blockchain is birthed out of an idea to bring the internet back to its true decentralised and distributed roots, unlike other technologies which was invented to maximise shareholders returns, blockchain purpose was to do the precise opposite -- whuch is to wrest control from these centralised organisations.

Did I choose blockchain? No. Blockchain chose me first. Then I chose Blockchain. The order matters.

Is blockchain a solution looking for a problem?

Laser was also labelled as a solution looking for a problem when it was first invented in 1960. Today my mum had her cataracts removed with lasers. At the checkout lanes at my nearby supermarket I use laser barcode scanners to check out. A solution looking for a problem is also a general purpose technology (gpt). Its far ranging applications will soon be realised.

| 1   | What makes blockchain different from distributed databases?                                        | Distributed DB --> Centralised control. Distributed DB --> Trust all the machines. Distributed DB --> Read/Write/Update. Blockchain --> Decentralised Control trust no machines. Blockchain --> Mistrust to no trust. Blockchain: Read/Append Only --> Distributed Immutable Single source of truth Blockchain Data Format --> Ordered List of records bundled into blocks which are then linked and secured using cryptography |
| 2   | How is blockchain revolutionary? To understand this, talk to the original architects (satoshi etc) | Blockchain will do for transactions what the internet did for information. DEPENDING ON WHO you ask, blockchains are either the most important technological innovation since the internet or a solution looking for a problem.         |                  
| 3   | Technical Definition of Blockchain                                                                | Linked batches of transactions known as blocks hence the term blockchain; trusted ledger shared across multiple parties in a decentralised way; Distributed ledger: type of distributed database that assumes the possible presence of malicious users (nodes) Blockchain: type of distributed ledger that is composed of a chain of cryptographically linked ‘blocks’ containing batched transactions; generally broadcasts all data to all participants in the network        |

Blockchain is all about storing and processing sensitive information – like financial transactions or voting records – on lots of different computers, rather than sticking it in all in one place.        |

Haikus on blockchains (or Blockchain on Haikus)


'Timeless Chain'

A chain of blocks

Immutable and limitless

Life is short

But the chain lives on 

Until a fork

--------

'Blocks, Chains and Time'

 Infinite number of transactions bundled together in blocks
 
 Many blocks chained together to form the blockchain

 Blockchain should become the chronological record of all human events and humans who have lived

Nathan Aw stands at the intersection of blockchain, crypto-law and economics. Equipped with deep understanding of blockchain and hands-on experience on distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), he helps shape the blockchain landscape with an eye toward a crypto-law future where any untrusting individuals could enter a contract with each other to transact value. He holds no crypto position.
